# Problem Statement
Monitoring patient progress in mental health treatment can be challenging due to the complexity of symptoms, behavioural changes, and individual responses to medication or therapy. Clinicians often struggle to identify:
- Which treatment methods are most effective?
- What behavioural factors predict patient improvement?
- How adherence levels influence outcomes?
- Which patients are at risk of deterioration?
- How symptoms, stress, mood, and sleep interact over time.
Without a structured analytical system, vital patterns may remain hidden, making it difficult to optimise care or tailor interventions to patient needs.

This project aims to solve these challenges by developing a data-driven dashboard that:
- Visualises patient progress in real time.
- Highlights key predictors of positive or negative outcomes.
- Tracks behavioural indicators such as sleep, mood, stress, and physical activity.
- Shows adherence levels and their direct impact on treatment success.
- Presents AI-detected emotional insights to support decision-making.
By transforming raw data into actionable insights, the dashboard enables clinicians, mental health researchers, and healthcare managers to make more informed, evidence-based decisions that can enhance patient well-being and treatment effectiveness.
