# Problem Statement
Monitoring patient progress in mental health treatment can be challenging due to the complexity of symptoms, behavioural changes, and individual responses to medication or therapy. Clinicians often struggle to identify:
- Which treatment methods are most effective?
- What behavioural factors predict patient improvement?
- How adherence levels influence outcomes?
- Which patients are at risk of deterioration?
- How symptoms, stress, mood, and sleep interact over time.
Without a structured analytical system, vital patterns may remain hidden, making it difficult to optimise care or tailor interventions to patient needs.

This project aims to solve these challenges by developing a data-driven dashboard that:
- Visualises patient progress in real time.
- Highlights key predictors of positive or negative outcomes.
- Tracks behavioural indicators such as sleep, mood, stress, and physical activity.
- Shows adherence levels and their direct impact on treatment success.
- Presents AI-detected emotional insights to support decision-making.
By transforming raw data into actionable insights, the dashboard enables clinicians, mental health researchers, and healthcare managers to make more informed, evidence-based decisions that can enhance patient well-being and treatment effectiveness.

# Overview
Mental health conditions often require continuous monitoring of symptoms, behaviours, and treatment responses to ensure positive patient outcomes. This project presents an integrated Mental Health Diagnosis and Treatment Monitoring Dashboard built in Microsoft Power BI. 
The dashboard transforms raw clinical and behavioural data into clear, actionable insights that help track patient progress, understand factors influencing improvement, and evaluate the effectiveness of different treatment methods.
The dataset includes key patient attributes, such as diagnosis, symptom severity, mood score, stress level, treatment duration, adherence percentage, emotional state (as detected by AI), therapy type, medication, sleep quality, and physical activity. 
By combining these variables, the dashboard provides a holistic view of patient wellbeing and treatment performance.
The solution is designed with three pages:
1. Overview Page: A high-level summary of patient distribution, outcomes, diagnoses, and treatment trends.
2. Clinical Outcomes Page: Focused analysis of improvement, deterioration patterns, and the relationship between symptoms and progress.
3. Predictors, Behaviour & Adherence Page: In-depth exploration of behavioural indicators, predictors of treatment success, adherence impact, and AI-driven emotional insights.
This project demonstrates the use of advanced Power BI capabilities such as DAX, Key Influencers, categorisation logic, outcomes scoring, and behavioural modelling to deliver a complete mental health analytics solution.
